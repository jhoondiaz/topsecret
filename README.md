>Project in NodeJS and AWS, which allows the user to detect the position and encode a message based on the data sent to 3 satellites.


## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org)
* [NPM](hhttps://www.npmjs.com/)
* [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)(Recommended)

## Usage

to use the service that processes satellites array:
  * in Postman create a new request of type POST
  * copy and paste the following URL: https://cc1hmhx8bb.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/v1/topsecret
  * in the body of the request add an object of type JSON with the following structure: 
  >`{
    "satellites": [
        {
            "name": "kenobi",
            "distance": 400.5,
            "message": ["este", "", "", "mensaje", "","","la"]
        },
        {
            "name": "skywalker",
            "distance": 671.9,
            "message": ["", "es", "", "", "secreto","para","","","","bien"]
        },
        {
            "name": "sato",
            "distance": 100,
            "message": ["este", "", "un", "", "","","","gente","de"]
        }
    ]
}`
  * execute the request

to use the service that processes distances from satellites to a specific position:
  * in Postman create a new request of type POST
  * copy and paste the following URL: https://cc1hmhx8bb.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/v1/topsecret
  * in the body of the request add an object of type JSON with the following structure: 
  >`{
    "position":{
        "x": -500,
        "y": 100
    } 
}`
  * execute the request


to use the service that independently stores sent distances:
  * in Postman create a new request of type POST
  * copy and paste the following URL: https://cc1hmhx8bb.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/v1/topsecret_split/{satellite_name}
  * in satellite_name options: kenobi,skywalker,sato
  * in the body of the request add an object of type JSON with the following structure: 
  >`{
    "distance": 1000,
    "message": ["este", "", "un", "", "","","","gente","de"]
}`
  * execute the request


to use the service that processes satellites array:
  * in Postman create a new request of type GET
  * copy and paste the following URL: https://cc1hmhx8bb.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/v1/topsecret_split/{satellite_name}
  * in satellite_name options: kenobi,skywalker,sato
  * no body required
  * execute the request
